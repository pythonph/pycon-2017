	The community in the Phillipines is amazingly welcoming and passionate. I met a large group of wonderful people, from the organizers, volunteers, speakers and attendees. I've gone to Pycons all over the world, and I'm always impressed that the Python community seems to attract such good natured and kind hearted people in all corners.

	PyCon PH was a memorable event that I am very glad I experienced. The talks were high quality, but most notably, the organisers and wider community were extremely warm and welcoming. I had such an excellent time! Thanks PyCon PH for putting on such an excellent conference.

	I loved my time at PyCon PH 2016. The technical content, especially Python's use in scientific research and innovative web development, was outstanding. My favorite part was the warm, welcoming, and eager Pythonistas.
