      The community in the Phillipines is amazingly welcoming and passionate. I met a large group of wonderful people, from the organizers, volunteers, speakers and attendees. I've gone to Pycons all over the world, and I'm always impressed that the Python community seems to attract such good natured and kind hearted people in all corners.
